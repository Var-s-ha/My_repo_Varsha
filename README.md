Understanding student behavior is critical in creating a supportive academic environment. This project introduces a model to analyze student disruptive behavior by determining the most effective clustering algorithm through experimental evaluation on a generalized dataset. The dataset encompasses various aspects of university students. We assess the effectiveness of hierarchical clustering utilizing the Ward method to uncover significant patterns. The Elbow Method is employed to ascertain the optimal number of clusters, thereby confirming the algorithm's reliability in segmenting student data. While the dataset does not specifically focus on disruptive behavior, the findings highlight the potential of hierarchical clustering for targeted analyses.
